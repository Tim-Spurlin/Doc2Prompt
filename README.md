# Doc2Prompt 

Doc2Prompt is an automated script built by **Tim Spurlin** to convert documentation files into structured prompts, generating a CSV file optimized for AI model training. This tool processes documentation page by page, leveraging AI to create effective structured prompts that capture key information for training models to understand and utilize the documented content. It is designed to streamline the process of preparing high-quality training data from diverse documentation sources.

---

## üìú Overview

Doc2Prompt automates the creation of structured prompts from various documentation formats (Word documents, PDFs, TXT files, HTML). It processes each page of documentation, uses AI to analyze the content, and generates a structured prompt for each page. The final output is a CSV file containing these structured prompts, ready for direct import into platforms like Google AI Studio for model tuning.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Automated Structured Prompt Creation**:  
  Utilizes AI (Google AI Studio API) to automatically generate structured prompts from documentation content.

- **Page-by-Page Processing**:  
  Processes documentation one page at a time to create granular and focused structured prompts for each section of the documentation.

- **Versatile Input Format Support**:  
  Handles various documentation formats including `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, and `.html` files, providing flexibility in the types of documentation that can be processed.

- **Configurable Output to CSV**:  
  Outputs the structured prompts in a CSV (`.csv`) format, which is directly compatible with Google AI Studio and other model tuning platforms.

- **Handles Long Responses**:  
  Automatically truncates generated structured prompts to adhere to character limits for model tuning, ensuring data validity. Flags truncated responses for user awareness.

- **File System Monitoring**:  
  Uses file system monitoring (`watchdog`) to automatically detect new documentation files added to a designated folder and process them in real-time.

## üîç Detailed Functionality

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Folder Monitoring**:  
   The script continuously monitors a specified folder for new documentation files.

2. **File Detection and Processing**:  
   When a new documentation file is placed in the watch folder, the script automatically detects it and initiates processing.  
   It extracts text content from the documentation file, regardless of its format (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.html`).

3. **Page Splitting**:  
   The extracted text content is intelligently split into manageable "pages" or sections to ensure focused processing and stay within AI model token limits.

4. **AI-Powered Prompt Generation**:  
   For each "page" of documentation, the script sends a prompt to the Google AI Studio API (Gemini model).  
   This prompt instructs the AI to analyze the page content and generate a structured prompt that captures the key instructional or code-related information.

5. **Structured Prompt Output**:  
   The AI-generated structured prompt for each page is captured.  
   The script ensures that the 'response' part of each structured prompt adheres to a 5,000 character limit, truncating if necessary and flagging truncated entries.

6. **CSV Output**:  
   All generated structured prompts, along with the original page content and truncation flags, are saved into a single CSV file (`structured_prompts.csv`) in a designated output folder.  
   This CSV file is structured with columns for 'page_content', 'original_response', 'response' (truncated and ready for tuning), and 'truncated' (flag).

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage Instructions

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. **Install Python and Dependencies**:  
   Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed.  
   Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv prompt_env
   source prompt_env/bin/activate  # Windows: prompt_env\Scripts\activate
   ```
   Install required Python libraries using pip:  
   ```bash
   pip install google-generativeai google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client google-auth watchdog python-dotenv pandas python-docx PyPDF2 beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:  
   Open the included `.env` file in the project directory.  
   Replace the placeholder with your actual Google AI Studio API key:  
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Prepare Documentation**:  
   Place your documentation files (`.docx`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.html`) in the designated "STRUCTURED PROMPT CONVERTER" folder on your computer:  
   `C:\Users\timsp\OneDrive\Desktop\STRUCTURED PROMPT CONVERTER`.  
   Ensure the "Structured" output folder exists:  
   `C:\Users\timsp\OneDrive\Desktop\STRUCTURED PROMPT CONVERTER\Structured`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Doc2Prompt

1. **Activate Virtual Environment**:  
   If you created a virtual environment, activate it in your terminal.

2. **Run the Script**:  
   Execute the `prompt_generator.py` script from your terminal within Visual Studio Code:  
   ```bash
   python prompt_generator.py
   ```
   The script will start watching the "STRUCTURED PROMPT CONVERTER" folder.

3. **Add Documentation Files**:  
   Copy your documentation files into the "STRUCTURED PROMPT CONVERTER" folder.  
   Doc2Prompt will automatically detect and process these files one by one.

4. **Check Output**:  
   Once processing is complete, a `structured_prompts.csv` file will be created in the "Structured" output folder:  
   `C:\Users\timsp\OneDrive\Desktop\STRUCTURED PROMPT CONVERTER\Structured`.  
   This CSV file contains your structured prompts, ready for import into Google AI Studio or other model tuning platforms.
